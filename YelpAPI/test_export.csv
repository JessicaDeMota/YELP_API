"I've been living down the street from Blue Ribbon Fried Chicken for the past year, and I love fried chicken, so (un)fortunately I've found myself there on many too-lazy-to-cook nights. It's a large, fast-casual eatery, lined with bright neon letters reminiscent of that Seinfeld episode where Kramer's apartment is flooded by the ""giant red sun"" of a Kenny Rogers sign across the street. And like Kramer, I've come to accept the eyesore in exchange for the best fast-casual chicken in the neighborhood.The breading they use here is very crispy, and relatively well seasoned, but a little dry. I noticed a lot of the lesser reviews tend to harp on its chicken tenders and nuggets, which I admit are not as good with this kind of breading; really good tenders and nuggets tend to be softer. It's much better on the thighs, wings, and drumsticks, where the crispiness goes perfectly with how rich and juicy the chicken is. The sauces are pretty great, especially all the honey options (Wasabi Honey!) that other fried chicken places tend to lack. The hottest sauce is actually the Gho-go sauce, a Korean Gochujang sauce made with ghost peppers, which will make you cry. (It's only available on the nuggets, but I've asked for some as a dipping sauce and they've happily complied).The sandwiches are also pretty good, although the Firebird isn't that hot, or maybe my tolerance is way too high... still searching for a good Nashville Hot Chicken sandwich in the city. The bowls are actually not that bad; they come with very good portions of rice, cabbage, edamame. Â The sides are okay but nothing spectacular. But for fried chicken, this is much better than fast food chains and fills an East Village niche that you won't find until you hit ktown.",298,1744,4.852348993288591,127,"i've been living down the street from blue ribbon fried chicken for the past year, and i love fried chicken, so (un)fortunately i've found myself there on many too-lazy-to-cook nights. it's a large, fast-casual eatery, lined with bright neon letters reminiscent of that seinfeld episode where kramer's apartment is flooded by the ""giant red sun"" of a kenny rogers sign across the street. and like kramer, i've come to accept the eyesore in exchange for the best fast-casual chicken in the neighborhood.the breading they use here is very crispy, and relatively well seasoned, but a little dry. i noticed a lot of the lesser reviews tend to harp on its chicken tenders and nuggets, which i admit are not as good with this kind of breading; really good tenders and nuggets tend to be softer. it's much better on the thighs, wings, and drumsticks, where the crispiness goes perfectly with how rich and juicy the chicken is. the sauces are pretty great, especially all the honey options (wasabi honey!) that other fried chicken places tend to lack. the hottest sauce is actually the gho-go sauce, a korean gochujang sauce made with ghost peppers, which will make you cry.

"A terrific fried chicken option elsewhere in the city, but most importantly in our neighborhood! I do love my fried chicken, but am not a huge consumer of fried foods so cannot eat more than a couple normal sized pieces at once. Therefore, their ""bowl"" options with marinated fried popcorn chicken is the perfect amount of fried chicken for me, with a healthy serving of everything else that would usually make up a healthy meal. The sesame teriyaki is a personal fave, and I don't usually need more sauce other than what's on the chicken.

"Walking up 2nd Ave on my way to meet a friend for drinks and I knew I would be drinking hard for a while, so I decided to stop in and fill my stomach with something since I had a few extra minutes.First off, don't go out of your way to come here.

TBH, the batter was very dry and powdery, so I had to douse it with sauce, which they didn't give me enough of, and since it was super dry and the sauce was super watery, I just wasn't coming together for me.

"Saturday afternoon, plenty of space available in this large casual fried chicken stop. Standard menu of various chicken pieces, meals, and comfort sides.Didn't really want fries (which are included in the combo), instead getting things ""a la carte"".

"Went to Blue Ribbon for the first time last night. I did not realize it was a fast casual place and not a full sit down restaurant. We placed our order at the counter and received a pager to inform us when to pick up the order.They have a neat sauce counter where they have wasabi honey, chipotle honey, wildflower honey, hot sauce, ketchup, and BBQ sauce. We picked up the food and dug in. We got 8 pieces of fried chicken, fries, three biscuits, and coleslaw. The coleslaw and biscuits were average. Biscuits could have used more salt and butter. Fries were meh. The fried chicken had a thick coating of breading that easily came off. It was super crunchy and very well seasoned, but it was almost too much breading. I've had better fried chicken that wasn't nearly as pricey, as our full order came out to over $50.

I got the Blue Bird sandwich because I love bacon, but it turns out there are only tiny bits of bacon on top of the chicken. The balance of veggies to meat ratio was also off. For a huge patty, I only got a slice of tomato and a small bed of lettuce dosed in sauce. Food is of decent quality and filling, but I feel as if they lack a distinct flavor to compete with other burger/chicken joints around. Their sauces are a good complement and the place was kept clean for the most part.",145,737,4.089655172413793,71,"blue ribbon is a step up from fast food, but i don't feel like there's anything special they offer that i would come back for. the good thing is that their food is at least the quality of what you pay for. no deflated looking sandwiches or soggy fries. i got the blue bird sandwich because i love bacon, but it turns out there are only tiny bits of bacon on top of the chicken. the balance of veggies to meat ratio was also off. for a huge patty, i only got a slice of tomato and a small bed of lettuce dosed in sauce. food is of decent quality and filling, but i feel as if they lack a distinct flavor to compete with other burger/chicken joints around. their sauces are a good complement and the place was kept clean for the most part.",blue ribbon is a step up from fast food but i dont feel like theres anything special they offer that i would come back for the good thing is that their food is at least the quality of what you pay for no deflated looking sandwiches or soggy fries i got the blue bird sandwich because i love bacon but it turns out there are only tiny bits of bacon on top of the chicken the balance of veggies to meat ratio was also off for a huge patty i only got a slice of tomato and a small bed of lettuce dosed in sauce food is of decent quality and filling but i feel as if they lack a distinct flavor to compete with other burgerchicken joints around their sauces are a good complement and the place was kept clean for the most part,blue ribbon step fast food dont feel like theres anything special offer would come back good thing food least quality pay deflated looking sandwiches soggy fries got blue bird sandwich love bacon turns tiny bits bacon top chicken balance veggies meat ratio also huge patty got slice tomato small bed lettuce dosed sauce food decent quality filling feel lack distinct flavor compete burgerchicken joints around sauces good complement place kept clean part,145
UPDATE: So the Habanero sauce is back!. I went to the Hell's Kitchen location during my lunch break from work to find out if that sauce was back and it was. I missed that flavor since my last trip to the Houston location. The perfect fried chicken flavor and that habanero sauce are meant to go together. Not to sound like a fat ass Â but that flavor is probably the most amazing thing when eating at Blue Ribbon.Definitely making more trips here as long as the key ingredient habanero sauce is here with the best fried chicken.,97,527,4.43298969072165,45,update: so the habanero sauce is back!. i went to the hell's kitchen location during my lunch break from work to find out if that sauce was back and it was. i missed that flavor since my last trip to the houston location. the perfect fried chicken flavor and that habanero sauce are meant to go together. not to sound like a fat ass but that flavor is probably the most amazing thing when eating at blue ribbon.definitely making more trips here as long as the key ingredient habanero sauce is here with the best fried chicken.,update so the habanero sauce is back i went to the hells kitchen location during my lunch break from work to find out if that sauce was back and it was i missed that flavor since my last trip to the houston location the perfect fried chicken flavor and that habanero sauce are meant to go together not to sound like a fat ass but that flavor is probably the most amazing thing when eating at blue ribbondefinitely making more trips here as long as the key ingredient habanero sauce is here with the best fried chicken,update habanero sauce back went hells kitchen location lunch break work find sauce back missed flavor since last trip houston location perfect fried chicken flavor habanero sauce meant go together sound like fat ass flavor probably amazing thing eating blue ribbondefinitely making trips long key ingredient habanero sauce best fried chicken,97
"I have always come Blue Ribbon Fried Chicken since high school. Lately though I noticed things changed with the sauces as of today (March 8, 2019). For one; I noticed that after I placed my order (Drum line combo + a beer), I went to look for the reason I come to break my healthy eating habit -- No habanero sauce. The orange tangy sauce I used to smother my fries and chicken with. I will forever miss that tangy spicy after taste that habanero sauce always gave me. I tasted the now current red sauce and honestly; It's plain, no taste and just makes me want blue ribbon to bring the habanero sauce back. Oh well, I will forever miss this place. Won't be coming back anytime soon.
